# Connect-Four-Python
How to create a boardgame called ConnectFour using python.
Connect Four is a game where players try to get four of their pieces in a row. (And here by "in a row" it does not mean the four have to all be in the same row, but rather a straight line of the pieces of one player, and that line can be in any direction, a row, column, or diagonal).
It is similar to tic tac toe, but the board is larger (6 rows and 7 columns) and players cannot put a piece anywhere. Instead they can only place a piece in a given column.  The piece will "fall" to the lowest empty space in that column.
